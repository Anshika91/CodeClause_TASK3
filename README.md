Description :  one of the most common cause of te accidents pn the road is sleepy drivers. in the USA each year drowsiness accounts for nearly 100k craches.
So it it essential to build a drivers drowsiness Detection system to avoid accidents that can detect wheather drivers are sleepy or not by looking and tracking their 
eye movement and alerting them with alarms. this project you can apply your computervision skill , such as CNN's and classify  wheather ddrivers are not sleepy.
